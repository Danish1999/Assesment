# Counter Application Test Plan

## Functionality Tests

### Initial State

1. **UI Elements**

   - Counter display should be visible and show 0
   - Increment button should be visible and enabled
   - Decrement button should be visible and enabled
   - Heading should contain "Counter:" text
   - Counter value should be properly nested in heading

2. **Initial Counter Value**
   - Counter should display 0 when the page loads

### Increment Operation

1. **Basic Increment**

   - Clicking increment button should increase counter by 1
   - Counter should increment from 0 to 1

2. **Multiple Increments**
   - Counter should handle multiple consecutive increments
   - Should correctly display larger numbers (e.g., incrementing to 5)

### Decrement Operation

1. **Zero Boundary**

   - Counter should never display negative numbers
   - Clicking decrement at 0 should keep counter at 0
   - Multiple decrements at 0 should keep counter at 0

2. **Decrement from Positive**
   - Clicking decrement at 1 should decrease counter to 0
   - Clicking decrement at any positive number should decrease by 1
   - Multiple decrements should stop at 0

### Edge Cases

1. **Rapid Interactions**

   - Rapid increment clicks should increment correctly
   - Rapid decrement clicks should decrement correctly and stop at 0
   - Mixed rapid increment/decrement should maintain correct count

2. **Boundary Testing**

   - Counter should never go below 0
   - Counter should handle transitions between positive numbers and zero
   - Multiple attempts to decrement at zero should be handled gracefully

3. **UI/UX**
   - Buttons should remain responsive during rapid clicks
   - Counter display should update immediately after each action
   - Counter should maintain correct state after multiple operations

## Test Implementation Priority

1. Initial UI element verification
2. Basic increment/decrement functionality
3. Zero boundary enforcement
4. Multiple operation sequences
5. Edge cases and stress testing

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Tests should run in under 30 seconds
- Tests should be stable and not produce false positives
- Test reports should be clear and actionable
- Page object pattern should be used for maintainability

## Test Coverage Matrix

| Test Category | Test Case           | Status |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| Initial State | UI Elements Present | ✅     |
| Initial State | Counter at 0        | ✅     |
| Increment     | Single Increment    | ✅     |
| Increment     | Multiple Increments | ✅     |
| Decrement     | Zero Boundary       | ✅     |
| Decrement     | From Positive       | ✅     |
| Decrement     | Multiple to Zero    | ✅     |
| Edge Cases    | Rapid Clicks        | ✅     |
| Edge Cases    | Zero Boundary       | ✅     |
| UI/UX         | Button States       | ✅     |
| UI/UX         | Display Updates     | ✅     |

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Stack

- Cypress for E2E testing
- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Page Object Model pattern
- Path aliases for clean imports

### Test File Organization

- Tests located in `cypress/e2e/`
- Page objects in `cypress/support/`
- TypeScript configuration in `cypress.config.ts`

### Configuration Details

- Base URL: http://localhost:3000
- Viewport: 1920x1080
- Screenshots on failure enabled
- Video recording disabled
- Retry configuration:
  - CI mode: 2 retries
  - Dev mode: 0 retries

## Test Implementation Priority

1. Basic UI Elements
   - Using TypeScript types for element selectors
   - Leveraging path aliases for imports
2. Counter Operations
   - Type-safe assertions
   - Strict type checking for counter values
3. Zero Boundary Testing
4. Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Test Execution

   - Tests should complete within 30 seconds
   - Screenshots captured on failure
   - No video recording to optimize CI performance

2. Code Quality

   - TypeScript strict mode enabled
   - No type assertions unless necessary

3. Reporting
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Type-safe error messages
   - Failure screenshots available in CI artifacts
